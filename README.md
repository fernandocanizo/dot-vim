# dot-vim

My configuration files for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).

Includes `~/.vim` directory and `~/.vimrc` as `~/.vim/vimrc` which I link at `$HOME` when bringing in configuration to new machines:

```
cd $HOME
ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
```

Feel free to peruse and use whatever you may find useful.
